# Term(inal) (in)Dex (Cards)

This repository is aimed at being a collection of composable, unix-ish tools to easily query, manipulate, edit and render markdown files as index cards. This isn't even alpha yet, but I'm open sourcing it early just because.


## Utilities

- [markdown_files](https://github.com/kunalb/termdex/tree/main/markdown_files): sqlite extension to build virtual tables from folders of markdown files
- [tdx](https://github.com/kunalb/termdex/blob/main/tdx): tiny bash script on top of the sqlite extension to manage notes and tasks
